# Software Testing Platform 

This repository contains the codes and the instructions to execute the testing process.

We are currently at developing stage and we aim to create a generic test platform for the embedded C codes. Suggestions/critics are always welcome and appreciated. Feel free to create issues to highlight the bugs and create pull requests to suggest. You can also contact directly to [Pranav Sankhe](https://sabsathai.github.io/). You can drop a mail as well at [pranavsankhe40@gmail.com](pranavsankhe40@gmail.com). 

As of now we are reading up on various testing platforms. The following are the ones we found which maybe relevant for us. 

- `pytest`
- `embunit`

More details on the above two platforms can be found in their respective folders.
